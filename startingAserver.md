To start your server:

1. open your terminal
	command + spacebar
	type in 'terminal'
	select the terminal

2. 'cd' into the file that your game is located in.
	ex. if your game folder is on your desktop you will first cd into Desktop, then cd into the name of your game folder

	hint: if you don't know where you are in your computer, type 'ls' to list the folders that you have available to you

	hint: if you mess up your terminal, or go into the wrong folder:
		'cd' to go all the way back to the beginning

3. When you get into the correct folder, start your server by typing:
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer

4. You will see "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ..." on the next line
	hint: if you don't get this, you had a typo. Go back and retype the command in Step 3

5. Go to Google Chrome, type in "localhost:8000"

6. Your game should show up. 
	hing: If you started your server inside of a folder that another folder is located, you will see a list of folders inside of that folder. Just select the game folder and your game should appear.
